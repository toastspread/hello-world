# hello-world

What up peeps,  

  I am Kelly.  I am married and have two kids, I love my family.  They all are kinda cool.  I recently just started a new job not really something I like to do but I need to make that paper, know what I am saying.  There are two types of jobs I would like to have.  One is meat cutting or being a butcher, I was one for seven years unfortunately I lost that job a few years ago and been struggling ever since.  The other job is something in either computer or cell phone software.  I currently have very little training in the software field, but I am currently working and trying to go a little further for it.
